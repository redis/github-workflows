This repository contains reusable GitHub Actions workflows for Redis projects.

== Release

This section describes the GitHub Actions workflow defined in `.github/workflows/release.yml` from the https://github.com/redis/github-workflows[Redis GitHub Workflows] repository.
This workflow provides a reusable release process for Gradle-based projects that can be called from other repositories, handling versioning, building, testing, and publishing to various platforms including Maven Central and Docker Hub.

=== Prerequisites

For this workflow to function properly, ensure your project has:

1. A Gradle-based build system with a https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/gradle_wrapper.html[`gradlew` wrapper]
2. Required secrets configured in your repository settings
3. https://jreleaser.org/guide/latest/quick-start/cli.html[Jreleaser configuration file] (`jreleaser.yml`)
4. A `README.adoc` file with a `:project-version:` attribute (if you're using the version updating features)

=== Workflow Steps

==== Cancel Previous Run

The workflow begins by canceling any previous runs of the same workflow to avoid conflicts:

```yaml
- name: Cancel previous run
  uses: styfle/cancel-workflow-action@0.12.1
  with:
    access_token: ${{ secrets.github-token }}
```

==== Repository Checkout

The workflow checks out the repository code.

Note the fetch-depth: 0 option on the Checkout workflow step. It is required for JReleaser to work properly. Without that, JReleaser might fail or behave incorrectly.

```yaml
- name: Checkout
  uses: actions/checkout@v4
  with:
    ref: ${{ inputs.branch }}
    fetch-depth: 0
```

==== Java Setup

Sets up the Java Development Kit based on the provided Java version:

```yaml
- name: Set up Java
  uses: actions/setup-java@v4
  with:
    java-version: ${{ inputs.java-version }}
    distribution: 'zulu'
```

==== Gradle Caching

Configures caching for Gradle to speed up builds:

```yaml
- name: Cache Gradle
  uses: actions/cache@v4
  with:
    path: ~/.gradle/caches
    key: ${{ runner.os }}-gradle-${{ hashFiles('**/*.gradle') }}-${{ hashFiles('**/gradle.properties') }}
    restore-keys: |
      ${{ runner.os }}-gradle-

- name: Cache Gradle wrapper
  uses: actions/cache@v4
  with:
    path: ~/.gradle/wrapper
    key: ${{ runner.os }}-gradlew-${{ hashFiles('**/gradlew') }}
    restore-keys: ${{ runner.os }}-gradlew-
```

==== Version Management

The workflow sets the release version number using the given input and writes it to the `VERSION` file as well as `README.adoc` so that documentation can reference the latest release version:

```yaml
- name: Version
  run: |
    echo "VERSION=${{ inputs.version }}" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
    echo ${{ inputs.version }} > VERSION
    git add VERSION
    sed -i -e "s/^\:project-version\:\ .*/:project-version: ${{ inputs.version }}/g" README.adoc
    git config --global user.email "${{ secrets.COMMIT_EMAIL }}"
    git config --global user.name "${{ secrets.COMMIT_USER }}"
    git commit --allow-empty -a -m "Releasing version ${{ inputs.version }}"
    git push origin ${{ inputs.branch }}
```

==== Build and Test

Executes the specified Gradle tasks:

```yaml
- name: Build
  run: |
    ./gradlew -Pprofile=release -PreproducibleBuild=true ${{ inputs.tasks }} -S
  env:
    GRGIT_USER: ${{ secrets.github-user }}
    GRGIT_PASS: ${{ secrets.github-token }}
```

==== Test Report Handling

If the build fails, test reports are uploaded as artifacts:

```yaml
- name: Upload test reports
  if: failure()
  uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
  with:
    name: test-reports
    path: |
      build/reports/aggregate-tests/
```

==== JReleaser Integration

The workflow uses JReleaser for assembling and releasing artifacts:

```yaml
- name: Assemble
  uses: jreleaser/release-action@v2
  with:
    arguments: assemble
    version: ${{ inputs.jreleaser-version }}
  env:
    JRELEASER_PROJECT_VERSION: ${{ inputs.version }}

- name: Release
  uses: jreleaser/release-action@v2
  with:
    arguments: full-release
    version: ${{ inputs.jreleaser-version }}
  env:
    JRELEASER_BRANCH: ${{ inputs.branch }}
    JRELEASER_DOCKER_GITHUB_USERNAME: ${{ secrets.docker-github-username }}
    JRELEASER_DOCKER_GITHUB_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.docker-github-password }}
    JRELEASER_DOCKER_DEFAULT_USERNAME: ${{ secrets.docker-username }}
    JRELEASER_DOCKER_DEFAULT_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.docker-password }}
    JRELEASER_GITHUB_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.github-token }}
    JRELEASER_GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.github-token }}
    JRELEASER_GITHUB_USERNAME: ${{ secrets.github-user }}
    JRELEASER_GPG_PASSPHRASE: ${{ secrets.gpg-passphrase }}
    JRELEASER_GPG_PUBLIC_KEY: ${{ secrets.gpg-public-key }}
    JRELEASER_GPG_SECRET_KEY: ${{ secrets.gpg-secret-key }}
    JRELEASER_NEXUS2_USERNAME: ${{ secrets.sonatype-username }}
    JRELEASER_NEXUS2_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.sonatype-password }}
    JRELEASER_PROJECT_VERSION: ${{ inputs.version }}
    JRELEASER_SLACK_WEBHOOK: ${{ secrets.slack-webhook }}
```

==== Output Artifacts

The workflow uploads JReleaser logs as artifacts:

```yaml
- name: JReleaser output
  if: always()
  uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
  with:
    name: artifact
    path: |
      out/jreleaser/trace.log
      out/jreleaser/output.properties
```

=== Usage Instructions

==== Calling the Workflow

To use this reusable workflow in your own repository, create a workflow file (e.g., `.github/workflows/my-release.yml`) with the following structure:

```yaml
name: Create Release

on:
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      version:
        description: 'Release version'
        required: true
        type: string
      branch:
        description: 'Branch to release from'
        default: 'main'
        required: false
        type: string

jobs:
  release:
    uses: redis/github-workflows/.github/workflows/release.yml@main
    with:
      version: ${{ github.event.inputs.version }}
      branch: ${{ github.event.inputs.branch }}
      java-version: '21'  # Optional, defaults to '21'
      tasks: 'build aggregateTestReports publish'  # Optional
    secrets:
      github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
      gpg-passphrase: ${{ secrets.GPG_PASSPHRASE }}
      gpg-public-key: ${{ secrets.GPG_PUBLIC_KEY }}
      gpg-secret-key: ${{ secrets.GPG_SECRET_KEY }}
      # Optional secrets based on your needs
      github-user: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_USER }}
      sonatype-username: ${{ secrets.SONATYPE_USERNAME }}
      sonatype-password: ${{ secrets.SONATYPE_PASSWORD }}
      docker-username: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_USERNAME }}
      docker-password: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_PASSWORD }}
      docker-github-username: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_GITHUB_USERNAME }}
      docker-github-password: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_GITHUB_PASSWORD }}
      slack-webhook: ${{ secrets.SLACK_WEBHOOK }}
```

=== Advanced Configuration

==== JReleaser Integration

This workflow heavily relies on JReleaser for the actual release process. To fully utilize its capabilities, you should have a proper JReleaser configuration in your project.

For JReleaser configuration details, refer to the https://jreleaser.org/guide/latest/index.html[JReleaser documentation].

==== Customizing Gradle Tasks

The `tasks` input allows you to customize which Gradle tasks are executed during the build phase. The default is `build aggregateTestReports publish`, but you can adjust this based on your project's needs.

==== Docker Publishing

To publish Docker images, ensure your project has proper Docker configuration and provide the required Docker credentials as secrets.

=== Troubleshooting


1. *GPG Signing Failures*
   - Verify that the GPG keys and passphrase secrets are correctly configured
   - Ensure the GPG key format matches what JReleaser expects (Base64 encoded)

2. *Build Failures*
   - Check the build logs for specific Gradle errors
   - Review the test reports that are uploaded as artifacts when builds fail

3. *Publication Failures*
   - Verify credentials for the target platforms (Docker, Maven repositories)
   - Check JReleaser logs for detailed error information
